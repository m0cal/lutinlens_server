# Latinisms Guidelines

To help simplify content for a global audience, avoid using Latin phrases that have simpler equivalents. Formal, academic content can be an exception or where space is constrained.

## Common Latin Phrases to Avoid

### e.g. (exempli gratia)
- **Instead use**: "for example" or "such as"
- **Example (incorrect)**: "RTX is incredibly useful in creative applications, e.g., applying effects or rendering video projects."
- **Example (correct)**: "RTX is incredibly useful in creative applications such as applying effects or rendering video projects."

### etc. (et cetera)
- **Instead use**: "and so on"
- **Example (incorrect)**: "The system supports various file formats like PNG, JPEG, GIF, etc."
- **Example (correct)**: "The system supports various file formats like PNG, JPEG, GIF, and so on."

### i.e. (id est)
- **Instead use**: "that is"
- **Example (incorrect)**: "The primary programming language, i.e., Python, is used throughout the codebase."
- **Example (correct)**: "The primary programming language, that is Python, is used throughout the codebase."

### versus (vs.)
- **Instead use**: "compared to"
- **Example (incorrect)**: "Cloud deployment vs. on-premises installation offers different benefits."
- **Example (correct)**: "Cloud deployment compared to on-premises installation offers different benefits."

### via
- **Instead use**: "by" or "through"
- **Example (incorrect)**: "Access the dashboard via the main menu."
- **Example (correct)**: "Access the dashboard through the main menu."

### vice versa
- **Instead use**: "conversely"
- **Example (incorrect)**: "Python can call JavaScript functions and vice versa."
- **Example (correct)**: "Python can call JavaScript functions and conversely."

## Exceptions

The following Latin phrases are exceptions because they are industry-standard terms with less-well-known substitutions. When using these terms, italicize them in running text:

- **in silico**: Computer-based simulations or modeling
- **in vitro**: Laboratory-based experiments outside living organisms
- **in vivo**: Experiments within living organisms

### Usage Examples for Exceptions
- "The *in silico* analysis revealed potential drug interactions."
- "These results were validated through *in vitro* testing."
- "The compound showed promising results in *in vivo* studies."

## Why Avoid Latinisms?

### Accessibility Benefits
- Makes content more accessible to non-native English speakers
- Reduces cognitive load for all readers
- Eliminates potential confusion about abbreviation meanings

### Clarity Benefits
- Provides explicit meaning rather than abbreviations
- Avoids assumptions about reader's Latin knowledge
- Makes documentation more scannable and understandable

### Global Audience Considerations
- Latin phrases may not translate well
- Some cultures may be unfamiliar with Latin abbreviations
- Simpler alternatives are universally understood

## When Latin Phrases May Be Acceptable

### Academic or Formal Context
- Research papers or technical specifications
- Legal documentation where precision is critical
- Scientific publications following established conventions

### Space Constraints
- Tables with limited column width
- UI elements with character limits
- Technical diagrams with space restrictions

**Note**: Even in these contexts, consider whether the simpler alternative would be better for your audience.

## Quick Reference

| Latin Phrase | Simple Alternative | Usage Context |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------|

| *in silico* | (keep as is) | Scientific/technical |
| *in vitro* | (keep as is) | Scientific/technical |

## Implementation Tips

### During Writing
- Use your editor's find/replace feature to identify Latin phrases
