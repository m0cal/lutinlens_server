# Capitalization Guidelines

Capitalize proper names of products, features, pages, and tools. In step-by-step instructions, match the exact capitalization of UI elements. Don't capitalize words that are not proper nouns solely for emphasis.

### Title Capitalization

#### For Headings and Titles
Capitalize:
- **First word** (always)
- **All nouns**: Requirements, Phase, Model
- **All verbs** (including short ones like "is"): Configuring, Testing, Building
- **All adjectives**: Quick, Advanced, Custom
- **All proper nouns**: NVIDIA, vGPU, NGC

Don't capitalize:
- **Articles**: a, an, the (unless first word)
- **Conjunctions**: and, but, or (unless >5 letters or first word)
- **Prepositions**: of, in, to, for (unless >5 letters or first word)

#### Examples
- **Correct**: "Requirements for Configuring NVIDIA vGPU in a DRS Cluster"
- **Correct**: "Deploying and Testing Your Text-based Bot"
- **Correct**: "Uploading a Model to NGC"

#### Action Titles
- Use gerund form (-ing) for action-oriented titles
- **Example**: "Installing the Toolkit" not "Install the Toolkit"

### Don't Capitalize

#### After Colons (Usually)
- **Standard**: "I have one true passion: horse racing."
- **Exception - Proper noun**: "There is only one place I want to visit: New York City."
- **Exception - Complete sentence**: "Maggie wears a cap for two reasons: Strong light gives her headaches. She likes how it looks."

#### Compound Words

#### Partial Quotes
- **Capitalize complete quotes**: Mario asked, "What is everyone doing this weekend?"
- **Don't capitalize partial quotes**: Gretchen said she was "way too busy" to join

#### Domain-Specific Terms (Unless Proper Names)
- **Use lowercase**: projects, applications, roles, workflows, functions
- **Exception**: When referring to specific proper names of products or features

## Technical Documentation Specific Rules

### UI Elements
- **Match exact capitalization** of interface elements
- **Bold and italic formatting**: Select *Settings* > *Data Inputs*
- **Button text**: Click **Save** or **Cancel**

### Code and Technical Terms
- **Follow language conventions**: JavaScript (capitalize), API (all caps), JSON (all caps)
- **File extensions**: Use lowercase unless following specific conventions
- **Commands**: Usually lowercase unless they're proper names

### Product Names
- **Use official capitalization**: 
  - NVIDIA NeMo Agent toolkit (first use)
  - Agent toolkit (subsequent uses)
  - CUDA, TensorRT, PyTorch
- **Don't capitalize** generic terms: database, server, application (unless part of proper name)

### Feature Names
- **Capitalize** official feature names: Smart Search, Auto-Save, Real-time Analytics
- **Don't capitalize** generic features: search functionality, automatic saving, real-time updates

## Common Capitalization Mistakes

### Don't Do These
- **Don't capitalize for emphasis**: Important becomes *important* (italic) not Important
- **Don't capitalize common nouns**: "The Database" should be "the database"
- **Don't capitalize job titles**: software engineer, project manager (unless in formal contexts)
- **Don't capitalize directions**: north, south, east, west (unless part of proper name)

### Special Cases

#### Ordinal Numbers
- **Always spell out**: first, second, third, twenty-first
- **Don't use**: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 21st in dates
- **Correct**: "June 21" not "June 21st"

#### Abbreviations and Acronyms
- **Follow standard conventions**: API, REST, HTTP, URL
- **Don't capitalize** unless the spelled-out form would be capitalized
- **Example**: "application programming interface" â†’ "API"

#### Version Numbers
- **Follow product conventions**: 
  - "version 2.1" (lowercase version)
  - "Python 3.9" (capitalize language name)
  - "CUDA 11.8" (follow product style)

## Best Practices

### Consistency
- **Use the same capitalization** for the same term throughout a document
- **Create a style sheet** for product-specific terms
- **Follow established conventions** within your organization

### When in Doubt
- **Check official documentation** for proper names
- **Use sentence case** rather than title case for most content
- **Err on the side of lowercase** for common nouns
- **Be consistent** with your choices throughout the document

### Accessibility
- **Consistent capitalization** helps screen readers
- **Proper capitalization** improves searchability
- **Clear conventions** reduce cognitive load for readers
