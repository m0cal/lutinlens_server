# Voice and Tone Guidelines

Write in a friendly, straightforward way that is authoritative, instructive, and welcoming to all audiences.

## Voice Characteristics

### Authoritative
Write with confidence and knowledge without being bossy, rude, or condescending.

#### Avoid Redundancy
- **Problem**: Unnecessary repetition that takes up space and obscures meaning
- **Example (incorrect)**: "The process of freeing a stuck vehicle that has been stuck..."
- **Example (correct)**: "The process of freeing a stuck vehicle consists of..."

#### Avoid Flowery Language
- **Problem**: Overly elaborate writing that uses complicated words to sound skillful
- **Example (incorrect)**: "High-quality learning environments are a necessary precondition for the facilitation and enhancement of the ongoing learning process."
- **Example (correct)**: "People need good schools if they are to learn properly."

#### Use Active Voice
- **Active voice**: Subject performs the action (strong, direct, clear)
- **Passive voice**: Subject receives the action (weak, indirect)
- **Example (correct)**: "Marti logged into the account."
- **Example (incorrect)**: "The account was logged into by Marti."

**Note**: Use passive voice only when the actor is unknown or when changing to active voice would alter the intended meaning.

#### Choose Appropriate Formality
- Use **second person** ("you") whenever possible
- Write prose that empowers the user to take action
- **Example (incorrect)**: "The product allows you to create multiple user segments."
- **Example (correct)**: "With the product you can create multiple user segments."

### Instructive
Make instructions immediately understandable without requiring multiple readings.

#### Writing Style for Instructions
- Use declarative, command, or direct address writing
- Use active instead of passive voice
- Include all necessary articles (a, an, the)
- Use action verbs
- Ensure graphics match descriptive text
- Keep text short but descriptive
- Avoid complicated jargon; use simple language
- Use concise headings and subheadings
- Leave plenty of white space around headings
- Highlight safety information and warnings
- Keep illustrations simple

#### Sentence Types

**Declarative Sentences**
- Relay information, opinions, and facts
- End with a period
- Have at least two words
- Include subject and predicate
- **Examples**: "The dogs barked at the moon." "Jim worked hard, but he failed the exam."

**Imperative Sentences**
- Issue commands and requests
- End with period or exclamation mark
- Can be as short as one word
- Don't explicitly state a subject (implied "you")
- **Examples**: "Close the door." "Stop!" "Come here, look at this dress, and tell me what you think."

**Usage**: Use declarative language most frequently in technical documentation, with imperative language when giving direct instructions.

### Welcoming to All Audiences
Consider accessibility and usability for the widest possible audience.

#### Accessibility Checklist
- Would this language make sense to someone who doesn't work here?
- Could someone quickly scan this document and understand the material?
- If someone can't see colors, images, or video, is the message still clear?
- Is the markup clean and structured?
- Does this work well on mobile devices with accessibility features?

## Writing Guidelines

### Use Second Person
- Address the reader directly with "you"
- Makes instructions more personal and clear
- Helps users understand they are the ones taking action

### Be Direct and Clear
- Get to the point quickly
- Use simple, clear language
- Avoid unnecessary words
- Choose specific verbs over generic ones

### Be Consistent
- Use the same terms throughout a document
- Follow the same style patterns
- Maintain consistent formatting
- Use parallel construction in lists and procedures

### Be Helpful
- Anticipate user questions and answer them
- Provide context when needed
- Include examples and use cases
- Link to related information when helpful

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Don't Use These Phrases
- "Simply" or "just" (implies something is easy when it might not be)
- "Obviously" or "clearly" (condescending if it's not obvious to the reader)
- "Please note that" (unnecessary filler)
- "It should be noted that" (wordy and impersonal)

### Avoid These Constructions
- "In order to" (use "to" instead)
- "Due to the fact that" (use "because" instead)
- "At this point in time" (use "now" instead)
- "For the purpose of" (use "to" instead)

### Don't Assume
- Don't assume users know background information
- Don't assume users have specific tools or permissions
- Don't assume users will read everything in order
- Don't assume users have the same level of expertise
