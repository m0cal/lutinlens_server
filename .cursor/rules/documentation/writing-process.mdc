# Writing Process Guidelines

Follow the structured 8-step writing process when creating or updating documentation.

## The 8-Step Writing Process

### 1. Understand Your Audience
- Identify who will read the documentation (developers, users, administrators)
- Consider their technical level and familiarity with the subject
- Determine what they need to know to accomplish their goals
- Ask: "What does the reader need to know to do what I want them to do?"

### 2. Determine Your Purpose
- Clearly define why you're writing the documentation
- Identify the specific outcome you want to achieve
- Determine if this is a user guide, developer guide, quick start guide, or other type
- Ask: "What do I want the reader to know or do after reading this?"

### 3. Brainstorm Your Ideas
- List all relevant information, facts, and concepts
- Include notes about writing style and approach
- Consider vocabulary and terminology
- Don't limit or reject ideas at this stage

### 4. Choose and Sort Your Ideas
- Select the best ideas that fulfill your purpose
- Eliminate anything that doesn't help achieve your goal
- Organize ideas into logical categories
- Ensure you have all necessary information

### 5. Organize Your Ideas into a Writing Plan
- Create a clear structure using lists, outlines, or diagrams
- Plan paragraph breaks and section headings
- Decide on formatting elements (headings, lists, charts, graphics)
- Eliminate anything that doesn't directly relate to your purpose
- Review: Will this plan fulfill your purpose? Are any steps or information missing?

### 6. Write the First Draft
- Follow your plan without worrying about perfection
- Don't focus on grammar, word choice, or spelling yet
- Keep your audience and purpose in mind
- Focus on getting ideas down

### 7. Revise, Correct, and Rewrite
- **Content review**: Ensure the writing fulfills its purpose
- **Clarity check**: Make sure it's clear and easy to understand
- **Structure review**: Check paragraph and sentence structure
- **Grammar and style**: Proofread for grammar, word choice, and style issues
- **Completeness**: Answer any questions readers might have

### 8. Send a "Clean" Draft to Your Reviewers
- Technical writers depend on subject matter experts (SMEs) for accuracy
- Ensure reviewers review the documentation thoroughly
- Incorporate feedback from reviews
- Do a final accuracy check with SMEs before publishing

## Best Practices

- Keep documentation current with product changes

## Documentation Types

### User Guides

- Use step-by-step instructions
- Include screenshots and examples
- Assume minimal technical knowledge

### Developer Guides

- Provide comprehensive technical details

### Quick Start Guides
