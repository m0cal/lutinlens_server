# Lists and Tables Guidelines

Lists organize information for faster scanning. Tables present descriptions of choices, options, and fields users encounter in tasks. Use these elements to improve content structure and readability.

## General List Best Practices

### Required Elements
- **Lead-in sentence**: Always introduce lists with a complete sentence
- **Multiple items**: Lists must have more than one item
- **Maximum two levels**: Primary list and sub-list only
- **Sub-list rules**: Sub-lists must also have more than one item

### Content Guidelines
- **Capitalize** the first letter of every list item
- **Parallel construction**: Use consistent sentence structure across items
- **One idea per item**: Keep each list item focused on a single concept
- **Link placement**: Avoid links that take users away from task lists
- **Minimal links**: If links are necessary, don't hyperlink entire list items

### Punctuation Rules
- **Complete sentences**: Use end punctuation if list items are complete sentences
- **Phrases/words**: No end punctuation for characters, words, or short phrases
- **Consistency**: Apply the same punctuation rule to all items in a list

## Types of Lists

### Bulleted Lists (Unordered)
**Use when**: Order doesn't matter (options, features, benefits)

#### Requirements
- Complete lead-in sentence ending with a colon
- More than one list item
- Up to two levels maximum
- Parallel sentence construction
- One sentence or idea per item
- End punctuation only if items are complete sentences

#### Example Structure
```markdown
The toolkit provides the following benefits:
- Easy installation and setup
- Comprehensive documentation
- Active community support
- Regular updates and improvements
```

### Numbered Lists (Ordered)
**Use when**: Order matters (sequential steps, procedures, priorities)

#### Requirements
- Complete lead-in sentence ending with period or colon
- More than one list item
- Up to two levels maximum
- Parallel sentence construction
- One action per list item
- Each step ends with period or colon
- End punctuation based on sentence completeness

#### Example Structure
```markdown
To install the toolkit:
1. Download the installation package
2. Extract the files to your desired directory
3. Run the setup command
4. Verify the installation
```

### Definition Lists
**Use when**: Defining terms, descriptions, explanations, or associations

#### Requirements
- Complete lead-in sentence
- More than one defined term
- Two levels: term (bold, own line) and definition (indented, own line)
- Parallel sentence construction
- One definition per term
- End punctuation in every definition

#### Example Structure
```markdown
Key concepts include:

**API**: Application Programming Interface that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.

**SDK**: Software Development Kit that provides tools and libraries for building applications.
```

## Table Guidelines

### When to Use Tables
- Reference information and lookup data
- Decision support matrices
- Compatibility information
- Choices and options for users
- Comparative information
- Configuration parameters

### Table Requirements

#### Structure
- **Introduction**: Full sentence with colon before table
- **Multiple rows**: Never create single-row tables
- **Headers**: Use title case for column headers
- **Titles**: Every table must have a descriptive title

#### Content Guidelines
- **Avoid empty cells**: Use non-breaking space if cell must appear blank
- **Minimal links**: Avoid links unless table's purpose is navigation
- **Limited code**: Use code samples sparingly in tables
- **No merged cells**: Avoid merging or splitting table cells
- **Lists in tables**: Use sparingly; prefer restructuring content

#### Example Structure
```markdown
The following table describes the configuration options:

| Parameter | Type | Description | Default |
|-----------|------|-------------|---------|
| timeout | integer | Request timeout in seconds | 30 |
| retries | integer | Number of retry attempts | 3 |
| debug | boolean | Enable debug logging | false |
```

## Formatting Best Practices

### Parallel Construction
Maintain consistent patterns:

**Good - Parallel verbs**:
- Install the package
- Configure the settings
- Start the service

**Bad - Mixed patterns**:
- Install the package
- Configuration of settings
- The service should be started

### List Organization

#### Logical Ordering
- **Alphabetical**: For reference lists (features, options)
- **Chronological**: For procedures and processes
- **Priority**: For recommendations or importance
- **Categorical**: For grouped related items

#### Length Considerations
- **Short lists** (3-7 items): Use simple bullet points
- **Long lists** (8+ items): Consider sub-categories or tables
- **Complex items**: Consider definition lists or tables

### Visual Formatting

#### Spacing
- Leave white space around lists and tables
- Use consistent indentation for sub-lists
- Separate complex list items with line breaks when needed

#### Emphasis
- **Bold**: For terms in definition lists
- **Italic**: For UI elements in instructions
- **Code**: For technical terms and values

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Don't Do These
- **Single-item lists**: Use paragraphs instead
- **Inconsistent punctuation**: Apply same rules to all items
- **Mixed sentence structures**: Maintain parallel construction
- **Overly complex tables**: Break into multiple simpler tables
- **Empty table cells**: Use descriptive text or non-breaking spaces
- **Too many sub-levels**: Limit to two levels maximum

### Better Alternatives
- **Instead of long paragraphs**: Use bulleted lists for multiple points
- **Instead of complex lists**: Use tables for structured data
- **Instead of nested lists**: Use headings and separate lists
- **Instead of single-row tables**: Use definition lists or paragraphs

## Accessibility Considerations

### Screen Reader Support
- Use proper markup for lists and tables
- Include table headers and captions
- Provide clear list introductions
- Use descriptive link text

### Scannability
- Use consistent formatting patterns
- Keep list items concise
- Use meaningful headings
- Group related information logically

### Translation Support
- Use simple, clear language in lists
- Avoid idioms in list items
- Keep parallel construction for easier translation
- Use standard punctuation patterns
