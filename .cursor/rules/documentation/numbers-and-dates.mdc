# Numbers and Dates Guidelines

Be consistent with number usage throughout documentation. When documenting examples or UI elements, duplicate numbers exactly as they appear in the interface.

## Numbers in Text

### Basic Number Rules

#### Spell Out vs. Numerals
- **Spell out**: Zero through nine in body text
  - "five databases"
  - "zero probability" 
  - "seven years"
- **Use numerals**: 10 and greater
  - "10 screen savers"
  - "28 days"
  - "12 hrs"

#### Consistency Rule
If one item in a group requires a numeral, use numerals for all items of that type:
- **Correct**: "One article has 16 pages, one has 7 pages, and the third has only 5 pages"
- **Correct**: "Christmas is only one month and 12 days away"

#### Adjacent Numbers
When two numbers referring to different things appear together, use a numeral for one and spell out the other:
- **Example**: "fifteen 20-page articles"

#### Starting Sentences
Never start a sentence with a numeral:
- **Correct**: "More than 10 apps are included"
- **Correct**: "Eleven apps are included"
- **Acceptable in lists**: List items may start with numerals

### Special Number Formatting

#### Commas in Numbers
- **Use commas**: For numbers with four or more digits
  - "$1,024"
  - "1,093 MB"

#### Exceptions to Comma Rule
For years, pixels, and baud, use commas only with five or more digits:
- **Years**: "2500 B.C." but "10,000 B.C."
- **Pixels**: "1920 × 1080 pixels" but "10,240 × 4320 pixels" 
- **Baud**: "9600 baud" but "14,400 baud"

#### Never Use Commas In
- **Page numbers**: "page 1091"
- **Addresses**: "15601 NE 40th Street"
- **After decimal points**: "1.06377 units"

#### Negative Numbers
Use an en dash (–), not a hyphen (-):
- **Correct**: "–79"
- **Incorrect**: "-79"

#### Compound Numbers
Hyphenate spelled-out compound numbers:
- "twenty-five fonts"
- "the twenty-first day"

#### Ordinal Numbers
Always spell out ordinals:
- **Correct**: "the first row", "the twenty-first anniversary"
- **Don't use**: "1st", "21st" in regular text
- **Don't use**: Ordinal numbers for dates ("June first" → "June 1")
- **Don't add**: "-ly" to ordinals ("firstly" → "first")

### Number Ranges

#### Preferred Format
Use "from," "through," and "to":
- **Example**: "from 9 through 17"

#### Exceptions
- **En dash for pages**: "pages 112–120"
- **En dash for years**: "2016–2020"
- **Use "to" for times**: "from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM"
- **Don't use "from" with en dash**: Wrong: "from 10–15"

### Abbreviations

#### General Rule
Don't abbreviate thousand, million, billion as K, M, B:
- **Preferred**: "65,000 people" or "sixty-five thousand people"
- **Preferred**: "$30 million" not "$30M"

#### When Abbreviations Are Necessary
- **Capitalize**: K, M, B
- **No space**: "8K", "30M", "2B"
- **Avoid decimals with K**: "8,210" not "8.21K" (same character count)

#### Global Considerations
- Machine translation may not handle abbreviations correctly
- Target languages may not have equivalent abbreviations
- Allow space for expansion in localized content

## Dates and Times

### Date Format

#### Standard Format
Use "Month DD, YYYY" format:
- **Correct**: "July 31, 2016"
- **Incorrect**: "31 July 2016"

#### Avoid Ordinals in Dates
- **Correct**: "Jan 18"
- **Incorrect**: "Jan 18th"

#### Global Considerations
Always spell out month names to avoid confusion:
- "6/12/2017" could be June 12 or December 6 depending on region
- "June 12, 2017" is unambiguous

### Time Format

#### AM/PM Format
- **Use**: AM and PM with space before
- **Capitalize**: Both letters
- **Examples**: "10:45 AM", "6:30 PM"

#### 24/7 Usage
Don't use "24/7":
- **Use instead**: "all day, every day", "always", "around the clock"

### Days and Months

#### Days of the Week
- **Capitalize**: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, etc.
- **Don't abbreviate** unless space is severely limited
- **Three-letter abbreviations**: Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat
- **Use sentence case**: "Sun" not "SUN"

#### Months
- **Capitalize**: January, February, March, etc.
- **Don't abbreviate** unless space is severely limited
- **Three-letter abbreviations**: Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec
- **No periods**: "Jan" not "Jan."

## Technical Context Numbers

### Limited Space Contexts
In tables and UI, numerals for 0-9 are acceptable:
- Tables with space constraints
- User interface labels
- Dashboard displays
- Mobile interfaces

### Code and Technical Values
Match exact formatting from code or systems:
- API response values
- Configuration parameters
- Version numbers
- Error codes

### Measurements and Units
- **Use numerals**: With units of measurement
  - "5 GB", "32-bit", "1080p"
- **Include units**: Always specify units for clarity
- **Standard abbreviations**: Use accepted technical abbreviations

## Best Practices

### Consistency Within Documents
- **Same type, same format**: Use consistent formatting for similar numbers
- **Document-wide rules**: Apply the same number style throughout
- **Style sheets**: Create guides for recurring number types

### Readability
- **Choose clarity**: When rules conflict, prioritize reader understanding
- **Context matters**: Consider your audience's expectations
- **Test with users**: Verify number formats work for your audience

### International Considerations
- **Decimal separators**: Be aware of comma vs. period conventions
- **Currency**: Follow local currency formatting when relevant
- **Date formats**: Stick to unambiguous formats
- **Number grouping**: Consider space vs. comma preferences

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Don't Do These
- **Inconsistent formatting**: "5 items" and "ten options" in same context
- **Starting with numerals**: "10 steps are required" (rewrite as "Ten steps are required")
- **Wrong dash types**: "-79" instead of "–79"
- **Ordinals in dates**: "June 21st" instead of "June 21"
- **Unnecessary abbreviations**: "5K users" instead of "5,000 users"

### Style Conflicts
When guidelines conflict, prioritize:
1. **User interface accuracy**: Match UI exactly
2. **Technical precision**: Use standard technical formats
3. **Document consistency**: Apply same rules throughout
4. **Readability**: Choose clearest option for audience
