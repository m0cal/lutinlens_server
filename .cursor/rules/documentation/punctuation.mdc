# Punctuation Guidelines

Use punctuation to provide vital clues for reader understanding. If a sentence contains more than a comma or two plus ending punctuation, consider rewriting it for clarity.

## Specific Punctuation Rules

### Ampersand (&)
- **Don't use** ampersands in place of "and"
- **Always write out** "and" unless the ampersand is part of a proper name
- **Exception**: "Search & Reporting app" (proper name)

### Apostrophes (')
Use apostrophes for:

#### Possessive Case
- **Singular nouns**: Add apostrophe + s, even if the noun ends in s, x, or z
  - `insider's guide`
  - `the box's contents`
  - `the CSS's flexibility`
- **Plural nouns ending in s**: Add only an apostrophe
  - `users' passwords`

#### Contractions
- `can't`, `don't`, `it's`

#### Don't Use Apostrophes For
- Possessive form of "it" → use `its`
- Possessive pronouns → `yours`, `theirs`
- Plural nouns → `devices` not `device's`

### Brackets

#### Angle Brackets (< >)
- **Use for**: Placeholder variables users should replace
  - **Correct**: `https://<user-specified-domain>.nvidia.com`
  - **Incorrect**: `https://{user-specified domain}.nvidia.com`
- **Use for**: Navigation sequences
  - Select *Save As* > *Saved Search* > *Close*

#### Curly Braces ({ })
- **Use only**: In code samples or string literals

#### Square Brackets ([ ])
- **Use for**: Configuration file stanza names
  - Edit the `[clevertap]` stanza
- **Use in**: Code contexts
  - `tag=dns query [search tag=malware]`
- **Don't use for**: Variable placeholders

### Colons (:)
- **Use to introduce lists**: End the introductory phrase with a colon
  - "We can create backups of the following:"
- **Use sparingly** for elaboration: One statement followed by an expansion
- **Lowercase** the word following a colon unless it's a proper noun or starts a complete sentence

### Commas (,)

#### Serial/Oxford Comma
- **Always use** a comma before the conjunction in lists of three or more items
  - "Google includes Mail, Calendar, People, and Tasks"
  - "Save to a hard drive, external drive, or OneDrive"

#### Other Comma Uses
- **After introductory phrases**: "With WhatsApp, users can call any phone"
- **Before conjunctions** joining independent clauses: "Select *Options*, and then select *Enable*"
- **Consider rewriting** long, complex sentences with multiple commas

### Dashes and Hyphens

#### Em Dash (—)
- **Use for**: Parenthetical phrases with more emphasis than parentheses
- **No spaces** around em dashes
- **Examples**:
  - "The information—numbers, formulas, and text—is stored in cells"
  - "Look at the illustrations in the wizard—they can help you"

#### En Dash (–)
- **Use for**: Ranges of numbers, dates, or pages
  - `2015–2017`
  - `pages 112–120`
- **Use for**: Minus signs
  - `12–3=9`
- **Use for**: Negative numbers
  - `–79`
- **No spaces** around en dashes (except in complex date/time ranges)

#### Hyphens (-)
- **Use for**: Compound modifiers before nouns
  - `built-in drive`
  - `high-level-language compiler`
  - `read-only memory`
- **Use when**: One word is a past or present participle
  - `left-aligned text`
  - `well-defined schema`

### Periods (.)
- **End all sentences** with periods, even short ones
- **One space** after periods, not two
- **Don't use** in headlines, headings, UI titles, or simple lists (≤3 words per item)

#### In Lists
- **Use periods** if list items complete the introductory sentence
- **Use periods** if any list item is a complete sentence
- **No periods** if all items are short phrases (≤3 words) and don't form complete sentences

### Quotation Marks (" ")

#### General Rules
- **Use double quotation marks** (" "), not single (' ')
- **Use straight quotes** in online content
- **Use curly quotes** in printed content (except in code)

#### Punctuation Placement
- **Commas and periods**: Always inside quotation marks
  - `He said, "I never forget a face."`
  - `History is stained with blood spilled in the name of "civilization."`
- **Colons and semicolons**: Always outside quotation marks
  - `Three elements of her "Olympic journey": family, commitment, coaching`
- **Question marks and exclamation points**: 
  - Inside if they apply to the quotation
  - Outside if they apply to the whole sentence

### Semicolons (;)
- **Use between** independent clauses not joined by conjunction
- **Use to separate** complex list items containing commas
- **Try to avoid**: Rewrite as multiple sentences or a list when possible
- **Example**: "Select the required *Option*; then select *Automatic* backups"

### Slashes

#### Backslash (\)
- **Use in**: Windows file paths and code

#### Forward Slash (/)
- **Use for**: Unix/Linux paths
- **Use sparingly** to mean "and," "or," "per," or "with"
- **Acceptable**: "read/write permissions"
- **Avoid**: "information is written to/stored in" (use "and" instead)

## Punctuation to Avoid in Technical Documentation

### Don't Use These
- **Ellipses (...)**: Creates uncertainty
- **Exclamation points (!)**: Too informal for most technical content
- **Question marks (?)**: Avoid rhetorical questions in instructions

### Exceptions
- These may be appropriate in user interface text
- May be used in marketing or introductory content
- Can be used when quoting actual user input or error messages

## Best Practices

### Clarity First
- If punctuation makes a sentence confusing, rewrite the sentence
- Use the minimum punctuation necessary to convey meaning
- Break complex sentences into multiple simple sentences

### Consistency
- Follow the same punctuation patterns throughout a document
- Use parallel punctuation in lists and similar structures
- Be consistent with spacing and formatting around punctuation

### Accessibility
- Clear punctuation helps screen readers and translation tools
- Consistent punctuation improves scannability
- Simple punctuation reduces cognitive load for readers
