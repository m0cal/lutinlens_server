# This config file demonstrates how to use multiple MCP tools from different servers
# in a single workflow. The workflow acts as an MCP client and connects to:
# - Calculator tools from an MCP server on port 9901 (toolkit-deployed)
# - Time tool from an external containerized MCP server on port 8080

general:
  use_uvloop: true

functions:
  # These tools are from the MCP server deployed by the toolkit
