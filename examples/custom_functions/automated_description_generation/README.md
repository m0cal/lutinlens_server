# Automated Description Generation Workflow

The automated description generation workflow, is a workflow that can be used to build on top of the RAG service and enhances the accuracy of the  multi-query collection workflow. The goal of the workflow is to automatically generate descriptions of collections within VectorDB's, which can be leveraged by the multi-query collection tool to empower retrieval of context, typically documents, across multiple collections within a given vector database. This document will cover the tooling and the process leveraged to execute the description generation workflow.

The documentation will also cover configuration considerations and how to set up a NeMo Agent toolkit pipeline that leverages the workflow. The current implementation is Milvus focused, with a plans to extend functionality to other vector databases.

## Table of Contents

* [Key Features](#key-features)
* [Installation and Usage](#installation-and-setup)
* [Example Usage](#example-usage)


## Key Features

- **VectorDB Collection Analysis:** Demonstrates automated generation of intelligent descriptions for VectorDB collections using document retrieval and LLM-based summarization to capture the essence of stored documents.
- **Multi-Query Collection Enhancement:** Shows how to enhance multi-query collection workflows by automatically generating feature-rich descriptions that improve retrieval accuracy across multiple collections.
- **Map-Reduce Summarization:** Implements a sophisticated approach using dummy embeddings for document retrieval, LLM-generated local summaries, and map-reduce techniques for final description generation.
- **Milvus Integration with Extensible Design:** Currently focused on Milvus vector database with plans for extension to other VectorDBs, demonstrating how to work with the NeMo Agent toolkit retriever interface.
- **RAG Service Enhancement:** Provides a foundation for improving RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) services by automatically generating more accurate collection metadata for better document retrieval.

## Installation and Setup

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#install-from-source) to create the development environment and install NeMo Agent toolkit.

### Install this Workflow:

From the root directory of the NeMo Agent toolkit library, run the following commands:

```bash
uv pip install -e ./examples/custom_functions/automated_description_generation
```

### Set Up API Keys
If you have not already done so, follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key. You need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable to access NVIDIA AI services:

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

### Setting Up Milvus

This example uses a Milvus vector database to demonstrate how descriptions can be generated for collections. However, because this workflow uses the built-in NeMo Agent toolkit abstractions for retrievers, this example will work for any database that implements the required methods of the NeMo Agent toolkit `retriever` interface.

The rest of this example assumes you have a running instance of Milvus at `localhost:19530`. If you would like a guide on setting up the database used in this example, please follow
the instructions in the `simple_rag` example of NeMo Agent toolkit [here](../../RAG/simple_rag/README.md#set-up-milvus).

If you have a different Milvus database you would like to use, please modify the `./configs/config.yml` with the appropriate URLs to your database instance.

To use this example, you will also need to create a `wikipedia_docs` and a `cuda_docs` collection in your Milvus database. You can do this by following the instructions in the `simple_rag` example of NeMo Agent toolkit [here](../../RAG/simple_rag/README.md) and running the following command:

```bash
python scripts/langchain_web_ingest.py --collection_name=cuda_docs
python scripts/langchain_web_ingest.py --urls https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aardvark --collection_name=wikipedia_docs
```
## Example Usage

To demonstrate the benefit of this methodology to automatically generate collection descriptions, we will use it in a function that can automatically discover and generate descriptions for collections within a given vector database.
It will then rename the retriever tool for that database with the generated description instead of the user-provided description. Let us explore the `config_no_auto.yml` file, that performs simple RAG.

```yaml
llms:
  nim_llm:
    _type: nim
    model_name: meta/llama-3.1-70b-instruct
    base_url: https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1
    temperature: 0.0
    max_tokens: 10000

embedders:
  milvus_embedder:
    _type: nim
    model_name: nvidia/nv-embedqa-e5-v5
    truncate: "END"

retrievers:
  retriever:
    _type: milvus_retriever
    uri: http://localhost:19530
    collection_name: "wikipedia_docs"
    embedding_model: milvus_embedder
    top_k: 10

functions:
  cuda_tool:
    _type: nat_retriever
    retriever: retriever
    # Intentionally mislabelled to show the effects of poor descriptions
    topic: NVIDIA CUDA
    description: Only to search about NVIDIA CUDA

workflow:
  _type: react_agent
  tool_names:
   - cuda_tool
  verbose: true
  llm_name: nim_llm
```

Like in the `simple_rag` example, we demonstrate the use of the `react_agent` tool to execute the workflow. The `react_agent` tool will execute workflow with the given function. However, you have noticed that the `cuda_tool` is incorrectly named and labelled! it points to a retriever that contains documents
from Wikipedia, but the agent may not know that because the description is inaccurate.

Let us explore the output of running the agent without an automated description generation tool:

```bash
nat run --config_file examples/custom_functions/automated_description_generation/configs/config_no_auto.yml --input "List 5 subspecies of Aardvark?"
```

**Expected Workflow Output**
```console

Instead, I will provide a general answer based on my knowledge.

Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: There is only one species of Aardvark, Orycteropus afer, and it has no recognized subspecies.

```

If we look at the full output from the toolkit, we see that the agent did not call tool for retrieval as it was incorrectly described. However, let us see what happens if we use the automated description generate function to intelligently sample the documents in the retriever and create an appropriate description. We could do so with the following configuration:

```yaml
llms:
  nim_llm:
    _type: nim
    model_name: meta/llama-3.1-70b-instruct
    base_url: https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1

functions:
  cuda_tool:
    _type: nat_retriever
    retriever: retriever
    # Intentionally mislabelled to show the effects of poor descriptions
    topic: NVIDIA CUDA
    description: This tool retrieves information about NVIDIA's CUDA library
  retrieve_tool:
    _type: automated_description_milvus
    llm_name: nim_llm
    retriever_name: retriever
    retrieval_tool_name: cuda_tool
    collection_name: wikipedia_docs

workflow:
  _type: react_agent
  tool_names:
   - retrieve_tool
  verbose: true
  llm_name: nim_llm
```
Here, we're searching for information about Wikipedia in a collection using a tool incorrectly described to contain documents about NVIDIA's CUDA library. We see above that we use the automated description generation tool to generate a description for the collection `wikipedia_docs`. The tool uses the `retriever` to retrieve documents from the collection, and then uses the `nim_llm` to generate a description for the collection.

If we run the updated configuration, we see the following output:

```bash
nat run --config_file examples/custom_functions/automated_description_generation/configs/config.yml --input "List 5 subspecies of Aardvark?"
```

```

We see that the agent called the `retrieve_tool`. This demonstrates how the automated description generation tool can be used to automatically generate descriptions for collections within a vector database. While this is a toy example, this can be quite helpful when descriptions are vague, or you have too many collections to describe!
