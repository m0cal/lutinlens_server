# Plot Charts Agent

A simple and reusable example that demonstrates creating charts from data using the NeMo Agent toolkit. This workflow can generate line charts, bar charts, and scatter plots from JSON data files based on user requests. The implementation follows NeMo Agent toolkit best practices for configuration-driven, reusable workflows.

* [Configuration](#configuration)
* [Example Usage](#example-usage)

## Key Features

- **Data Visualization Workflow:** Demonstrates a custom `plot_charts` workflow type that generates line charts, bar charts, and scatter plots from JSON data files based on natural language requests.
- **Python Plotting Integration:** Shows how to integrate Python's `matplotlib` library for chart generation within the NeMo Agent toolkit framework.
- **JSON Data Processing:** Demonstrates parsing and visualization of structured JSON data with configurable x-values and multiple y-value series with labels.
- **LLM-Enhanced Descriptions:** Uses configured LLMs to generate intelligent, contextual descriptions of the created charts for better user understanding.
- **Configurable Chart Parameters:** Shows how to customize chart types, data sources, output directories, figure sizes, and data point limits through YAML configuration.

## Installation and Setup

### Setup Virtual Environment and Install NeMo Agent Toolkit

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#install-from-source) to create the development environment and install NeMo Agent toolkit.

### Install this Workflow:

From the root directory of the NeMo Agent toolkit library, run the following commands:

```bash
uv pip install -e examples/custom_functions/plot_charts
```

### Set Up API Keys

If you have not already done so, follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key. You need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable to access NVIDIA AI services:

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

## Configuration

The workflow is fully configurable through the `config.yml` file. Here are the available configuration options:

### Data Configuration
- **`data_file_path`**: Path to the JSON data file (default: `"example_data.json"`)
- **`output_directory`**: Directory where charts will be saved (default: `"outputs"`)

### Chart Configuration
- **`chart_types`**: List of supported chart types (default: `["line", "bar", "scatter"]`)
- **`max_data_points`**: Maximum number of data points to prevent excessive processing (default: `100`)
- **`figure_size`**: Chart dimensions as [width, height] (default: `[10, 6]`)

### Example Configuration

```yaml
workflow:
  _type: plot_charts
  llm_name: nim_llm
  data_file_path: "my_custom_data.json"
  output_directory: "my_charts"
  chart_types: ["line", "bar"]
  max_data_points: 50
  figure_size: [12, 8]
```

### Data Format

The data file should be in JSON format with the following structure:

```json
{
  "xValues": ["2020", "2021", "2022", "2023", "2024"],
  "yValues": [
    {
      "data": [2, 5, 2.2, 7.5, 3],
      "label": "USA"
    },
    {
      "data": [2, 5.5, 2, 8.5, 1.5],
      "label": "EMEA"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Example Usage

### Run the Workflow

Run the following command from the root of the NeMo Agent toolkit repo to execute this workflow:

```bash
nat run --config_file examples/custom_functions/plot_charts/configs/config.yml --input "create a line chart"
```

**Expected Workflow Output**
```console
<snipped for brevity>

Workflow Result:
['Successfully created line chart saved to: outputs/line_chart_1752875308.png\n\nChart description: The line chart shows the trend of two regions, USA and EMEA, over a 5-year period from 2020 to 2024, with both regions experiencing fluctuations in their values. The USA region appears to have a more stable trend, while the EMEA region shows a more significant increase in 2021 and 2023, followed by a sharp decline in 2024.']
```

### Different Chart Types

You can request different chart types:

```bash
# Bar chart
nat run --config_file examples/custom_functions/plot_charts/configs/config.yml --input "create a bar chart comparing the data"

# Scatter plot
nat run --config_file examples/custom_functions/plot_charts/configs/config.yml --input "show me a scatter plot"
```

### Launch the Workflow Server

Run the following command from the root of the NeMo Agent toolkit repo to serve this workflow:

```bash
nat serve --config_file examples/custom_functions/plot_charts/configs/config.yml
```

**Triggering the Workflow Server**

The workflow server can be triggered using the following curl command:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8000/generate \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"input_message": "create a line chart showing trends over time"}'
```

**Expected Output**
```json
{
  "value": "Successfully created line chart saved to: outputs/line_chart_1703123456.png\n\nChart description: The line chart displays comparative performance data for USA and EMEA regions across a five-year period."
}
```

## Customization Examples

### Using Different Data Sources

1. Create your own data file following the JSON format above
2. Update the configuration:

<!-- path-check-skip-begin -->
```yaml
workflow:
  _type: plot_charts
  llm_name: nim_llm
  data_file_path: "path/to/your/data.json"
```
<!-- path-check-skip-end -->

### Customizing Chart Types

To support only specific chart types:

```yaml
workflow:
  _type: plot_charts
  llm_name: nim_llm
  chart_types: ["bar"]  # Only bar charts
```

### Changing Output Location

To save charts to a specific directory:

```yaml
workflow:
  _type: plot_charts
  llm_name: nim_llm
  output_directory: "/path/to/your/charts"
```
