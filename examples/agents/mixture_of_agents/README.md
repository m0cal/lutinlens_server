# Mixture of Agents Example

An example of a Mixture of Agents (naive Mixture of Experts / naive Agent Hypervisor). This agent leverages the NeMo Agent toolkit plugin system and `WorkflowBuilder` to integrate pre-built and custom tools into the workflows, and workflows as tools. Key elements are summarized below:

  - [Making Requests to the NeMo Agent Toolkit Server](#making-requests-to-the-nemo-agent-toolkit-server)

## Key Features

- **Hierarchical Agent Architecture:** Demonstrates a `react_agent` serving as a master orchestrator that routes queries to specialized `tool_calling_agent` experts based on query content and agent descriptions.
- **Multiple Specialized Agents:** Includes distinct expert agents for different domains - an `internet_agent` for web searches, a `code_agent` for programming tasks, and additional specialized agents.
- **Agent-as-Tool Integration:** Shows how complete agent workflows can be wrapped and used as tools by other agents, enabling complex multi-agent orchestration.
- **Mixed Agent Types:** Combines ReAct agents (for orchestration and reasoning) with Tool Calling agents (for specialized execution), demonstrating interoperability between different agent frameworks.
- **Scalable Expert System:** Provides a pattern for building systems where a reasoning agent can delegate work to multiple domain-specific expert agents, each with their own specialized tool sets.

## Graph Structure

Both the ReAct agent and Tool Calling agents in this mixture follow the same dual-node graph architecture that alternates between reasoning and tool execution. The following diagram illustrates the shared workflow pattern:

<div align="center">
<img src="../../../docs/source/_static/dual_node_agent.png" alt="Dual Node Agent Graph Structure" width="400" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

**Shared Workflow Pattern:**
- **Start**: Each agent begins processing with input
- **Agent Node**: Performs reasoning and decides whether to use a tool or provide a final answer
- **Conditional Edge**: Routes the flow based on the agent's decision
- **Tool Node**: Executes the selected tool when needed
- **Cycle**: Agents can loop between reasoning and tool execution until reaching a final answer

This consistent architecture allows both ReAct and Tool Calling agents to work seamlessly together in the mixture, each contributing their specialized capabilities while following the same operational pattern.

## Installation and Setup

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#install-from-source) to create the development environment and install NeMo Agent toolkit.

### Install this Workflow

From the root directory of the NeMo Agent toolkit repository, run the following commands:

```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

### Set Up API Keys
If you have not already done so, follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key. You need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable to access NVIDIA AI services:
```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

### Run the Workflow

Run the following command from the root of the NeMo Agent toolkit repo to execute this workflow with the specified input:

```bash
nat run --config_file=examples/agents/mixture_of_agents/configs/config.yml --input "who was Djikstra?"
```

**Expected Output**

content="Dijkstra's algorithm is a well-known algorithm in graph theory, named after the Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra.
