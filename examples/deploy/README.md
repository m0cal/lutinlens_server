## Key Features

- **Docker Compose Services:** Provides pre-configured Docker Compose files for essential services used across NeMo Agent toolkit examples.
- **Redis Service:** Includes `docker-compose.redis.yml` for running Redis memory backend with Redis Insight for memory-based examples.
- **Phoenix Observability:** Includes `docker-compose.phoenix.yml` for running Phoenix observability server to monitor and debug workflows.
- **Example Support Infrastructure:** Simplifies setup of supporting services required by various examples in the repository.

## Available Services

- **`redis`**: `docker-compose.redis.yml`
- **`phoenix`**: `docker-compose.phoenix.yml`

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure that Docker is installed and the Docker service is running before proceeding.

- Install Docker: Follow the official installation guide for your platform: [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- Start Docker Service:
  - Linux: Run`sudo systemctl start docker` (ensure your user has permission to run Docker).
  - Mac & Windows: Docker Desktop should be running in the background.
- Verify Docker Installation: Run the following command to verify that Docker is installed and running correctly:
```bash
docker info
```

### Running Services

To start Redis (required for redis-based examples):
```bash
docker compose -f examples/deploy/docker-compose.redis.yml up -d
```

To start Phoenix (for observability examples):
```bash
docker compose -f examples/deploy/docker-compose.phoenix.yml up -d
```

### Stopping Services

```bash
docker compose -f examples/deploy/docker-compose.redis.yml down
docker compose -f examples/deploy/docker-compose.phoenix.yml down
```
