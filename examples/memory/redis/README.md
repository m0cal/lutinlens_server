# Redis Examples

These examples use the redis memory backend.

## Key Features

- **Redis Memory Backend Integration:** Demonstrates how to integrate Redis as a memory backend for NeMo Agent toolkit workflows, enabling persistent memory storage and retrieval across agent interactions.
- **Chat Memory Management:** Shows implementation of simple chat functionality with the ability to create, store, and recall memories using Redis as the underlying storage system.
- **Embeddings-Based Memory Search:** Uses embeddings models to create vector representations of queries and stored memories, implementing HNSW indexing with L2 distance metrics for efficient similarity search.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that Docker is installed and the Docker service is running before proceeding.

- Install Docker: Follow the official installation guide for your platform: [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- Start Docker Service:
  - Linux: Run `sudo systemctl start docker` (ensure your user has permission to run Docker).
  - Mac & Windows: Docker Desktop should be running in the background.
- Verify Docker Installation: Run the following command to verify that Docker is installed and running correctly:
```bash
docker info
```

## Installation and Setup

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#install-from-source) to create the development environment and install NeMo Agent toolkit.

To run this example, install the required dependencies by running the following command:
```bash
uv sync --extra langchain --extra redis --extra telemetry
```

### Start Services

Run redis on `localhost:6379` and Redis Insight on `localhost:5540` with:

```bash
docker compose -f examples/deploy/docker-compose.redis.yml up
```

The examples are configured to use the Phoenix observability tool. Start phoenix on `localhost:6006` with:

```bash
docker compose -f examples/deploy/docker-compose.phoenix.yml up
```

## Run the Workflow

This example shows how to have a simple chat that uses a Redis memory backend for creating and retrieving memories.

An embeddings model is used to create embeddings for queries and for stored memories. Uses HNSW and L2 distance metric.

### Create Memory

Here we will add a memory for the workflow to use in following invocations. The memory tool will automatically determine the intent as to whether or not an input should be stored as a "fact" or if the input should be used to query the memory.

```bash
nat run --config_file=examples/memory/redis/configs/config.yml --input "my favorite flavor is strawberry"
```

**Expected Workflow Output**
```console
<snipped for brevity>

Workflow Result:
['The user's favorite flavor has been stored as strawberry.']
```

### Recall Memory

Once we have established something in the memory, we can use the workflow to give us a response based on its input.

```bash
nat run --config_file=examples/memory/redis/configs/config.yml --input "what flavor of ice-cream should I get?"
```

**Expected Workflow Output**
```console
<snipped for brevity>

Workflow Result:
['You should get strawberry ice cream, as it is your favorite flavor.']
```
