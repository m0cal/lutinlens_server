## Key Features

- **Object Store Integration:** Demonstrates comprehensive integration with object storage systems including AWS S3 and MinIO for storing and retrieving user report data.
- **Multi-Database Support:** Shows support for both object stores (S3-compatible) and relational databases (MySQL) for flexible data storage architectures.
- **File Server Backend:** Provides a complete file server implementation with object store backing, supporting REST API operations for upload, download, update, and delete.
- **Real-Time Report Management:** Enables dynamic creation, retrieval, and management of user reports through natural language interfaces with automatic timestamp handling.
- **Mock Data Pipeline:** Includes complete setup scripts and mock data for testing object store workflows without requiring production data sources.

## Installation and Setup
If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#install-from-source) to create the development environment and install NeMo Agent toolkit, and follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key.

### Install this Workflow

From the root directory of the NeMo Agent toolkit repository, run the following commands:

```bash
uv pip install -e examples/object_store/user_report
```

### Set Up API Keys
If you have not already done so, follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key. You need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable to access NVIDIA AI services:

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

### Setting up MinIO (Optional)
If you want to run this example in a local setup without creating a bucket in AWS, you can set up MinIO in your local machine. MinIO is an object storage system and acts as drop-in replacement for AWS S3.

For the up-to-date installation instructions of MinIO, see [MinIO Page](https://github.com/minio/minio) and MinIO client see [MinIO Client Page](https://github.com/minio/mc)

#### macOS
To install MinIO on your macOS machine, run the following commands:
<!-- path-check-skip-begin -->
```bash
brew install minio/stable/mc
mc --help
mc alias set myminio http://localhost:9000 minioadmin minioadmin

brew install minio/stable/minio
```
<!-- path-check-skip-end -->

#### Linux
To install MinIO on your Linux machine, run the following commands:
<!-- path-check-skip-begin -->
```bash
curl https://dl.min.io/client/mc/release/linux-amd64/mc \
  --create-dirs \
  -o $HOME/minio-binaries/mc

chmod +x $HOME/minio-binaries/mc
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/minio-binaries/
mc --help
mc alias set myminio http://localhost:9000 minioadmin minioadmin

wget https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/linux-amd64/archive/minio_20250422221226.0.0_amd64.deb -O minio.deb
sudo dpkg -i minio.deb
```
<!-- path-check-skip-end -->

### Start the MinIO Server
To start the MinIO server, run the following command:
```bash
minio server ~/.minio
```

### Useful MinIO Commands

List buckets:
```bash
mc ls myminio
```

List all files in a bucket:
<!-- path-check-skip-begin -->
```bash
mc ls --recursive myminio/my-bucket
```
<!-- path-check-skip-end -->

### Load Mock Data to MiniIO
To load mock data to minIO, use the `upload_to_minio.sh` script in this directory. For this example, we will load the mock user reports in the `data/object_store` directory.

```bash
cd examples/object_store/user_report/
./upload_to_minio.sh data/object_store myminio my-bucket
```

### Setting up the MySQL Server (Optional)

#### Linux (Ubuntu)

1. Install MySQL Server:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-server
```

2. Verify installation:
```
sudo systemctl status mysql
```

Make sure that the service is `active (running)`.

3. The default installation of the MySQL server allows root access only if youâ€™re the system user "root" (socket-based authentication). To be able to connect using the root user and password, run the following command:
```
sudo mysql
```

4. Inside the MySQL console, run the following command (you can choose any password but make sure it matches the one used in the config):
```
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost'
  IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'my_password';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
quit
```

Note: This is not a secure configuration and should not to be used in production systems.

5. Back in the terminal:
```bash
sudo service mysql restart
```

### Load Mock Data to MySQL Server
To load mock data to the MySQL server:

1. Update the MYSQL configuration:
```bash
sudo tee /etc/mysql/my.cnf > /dev/null <<EOF
[mysqld]
secure_file_priv=""
EOF
```

2. Append this rule to MySQL's AppArmor profile local override:
```bash
echo "/tmp/** r," | sudo tee -a /etc/apparmor.d/local/usr.sbin.mysqld
```

3. Reload the AppArmor policy:
```bash
sudo apparmor_parser -r /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysqld
```

4. Restart the MySQL server:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart mysql
```

5. Use the `upload_to_mysql.sh` script in this directory. For this example, we will load the mock user reports in the `data/object_store` directory.

```bash
cd examples/object_store/user_report/
./upload_to_mysql.sh root my_password data/object_store my-bucket
```

## NeMo Agent Toolkit File Server

By adding the `object_store` field in the `general.front_end` block of the configuration, clients directly download and
upload files to the connected object store. An example configuration looks like:

```yaml
general:
  front_end:
    object_store: my_object_store
    ...

object_stores:
  my_object_store:
  ...
```

You can start the server by running:
```bash
nat serve --config_file examples/object_store/user_report/configs/config_s3.yml
```

### Using the Object Store Backed File Server (Optional)

- Download an object: `curl -X GET http://<hostname>:<port>/static/{file_path}`
- Upload an object: `curl -X POST http://<hostname>:<port>/static/{file_path}`
- Upsert an object: `curl -X PUT http://<hostname>:<port>/static/{file_path}`
- Delete an object: `curl -X DELETE http://<hostname>:<port>/static/{file_path}`

If any of the loading scripts were run and the files are in the object store, example commands are:

- Get an object: `curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/static/reports/67890/latest.json`
- Delete an object: `curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/static/reports/67890/latest.json`

## Run the Workflow

For each of the following examples, a command is provided to run the workflow with the specified input. Run the following command from the root of the NeMo Agent toolkit repo to execute the workflow.

### Get User Report
```
nat run --config_file examples/object_store/user_report/configs/config_s3.yml --input "Give me the latest report of user 67890"
```

**Expected Workflow Output**
```console
<snipped for brevity>

[AGENT]
