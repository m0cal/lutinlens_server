# Personal Finance

<!-- Note: "Agno" is the official product name despite Vale spelling checker warnings -->
Built on [Agno](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno) and NeMo Agent toolkit, this workflow is a personal financial planner that generates personalized financial plans using NVIDIA NIM (can be customized to use OpenAI models). It automates the process of researching, planning, and creating tailored budgets, investment strategies, and savings goals, empowering you to take control of your financial future with ease.

This personal financial planner was revised based on the [Awesome-LLM-App](https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps) GitHub repo's [AI Personal Finance Planner](https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps/tree/main/advanced_ai_agents/single_agent_apps/ai_personal_finance_agent) sample.

## Deployment-Oriented Setup

For a production deployment, use Docker:

### Build the Docker Image

Prior to building the Docker image ensure that you have followed the steps in the [Installation and Setup](#installation-and-setup) section, and you are currently in the NeMo Agent toolkit virtual environment.

From the root directory of the NeMo Agent toolkit repository, build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build --build-arg NAT_VERSION=$(python -m setuptools_scm) -t agno_personal_finance -f examples/frameworks/agno_personal_finance/Dockerfile .
```

### Run the Docker Container
Deploy the container:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 -e NVIDIA_API_KEY -e OPENAI_API_KEY -e SERP_API_KEY agno_personal_finance
```

### Test the API
Use the following curl command to test the deployed API:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/generate' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"inputs": "My financial goal is to retire at age 60.  I am currently 40 years old, working as a Machine Learning engineer at NVIDIA."}'
```

### Expected API Output
The API response should look like this:

```json
