# A Simple LangSmith-Documentation Agent

A minimal example demonstrating a simple LangSmith-Documentation agent. This agent leverages the NeMo Agent toolkit plugin system and `Builder` to integrate pre-built and custom tools into the workflow to answer questions about LangSmith. Key elements are summarized below:

---

## Key Features

- **Webpage Query Tool:** Demonstrates a `webpage_query` tool that retrieves and processes documentation from LangSmith's website (https://docs.smith.langchain.com) using web scraping and vector search.
- **ReAct Agent Integration:** Uses a `react_agent` that reasons about user queries and determines when to retrieve relevant documentation from the web.
- **Document Retrieval and Embedding:** Shows how to automatically generate embeddings from web content and perform semantic search to answer questions about LangSmith.
- **End-to-End Web RAG:** Complete example of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using web-scraped content as the knowledge source.
- **YAML-based Configuration:** Fully configurable workflow demonstrating integration of web scraping, embeddings, and agent reasoning through simple configuration.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that Docker is installed and the Docker service is running before proceeding.

- Install Docker: Follow the official installation guide for your platform: [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- Start Docker Service:
  - Linux: Run`sudo systemctl start docker` (ensure your user has permission to run Docker).
  - Mac & Windows: Docker Desktop should be running in the background.
- Verify Docker Installation: Run the following command to verify that Docker is installed and running correctly:
  ```bash
  docker info
  ```

## Installation and Setup

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#install-from-source) to create the development environment and install NeMo Agent toolkit.

### Install this Workflow:

From the root directory of the NeMo Agent toolkit library, run the following commands:

```bash
uv pip install -e examples/getting_started/simple_web_query
```

### Set Up API Keys
If you have not already done so, follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key. You need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable to access NVIDIA AI services:

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

## Running the Workflow

Run the following command from the root of the NeMo Agent toolkit repo to execute this workflow with the specified input:

```bash
nat run --config_file examples/getting_started/simple_web_query/configs/config.yml --input "What is LangSmith?"
```

**Expected Workflow Output**
```console
<snipped for brevity>

Workflow Result:
['LangSmith is a platform for building production-grade LLM (Large Language Model) applications, allowing users to monitor and evaluate their applications, and providing features such as observability, evaluation, and prompt engineering. It is framework-agnostic and can be used with or without LangChain's open source frameworks.']
```

## Docker Quickstart

Prior to building the Docker image ensure that you have followed the steps in the [Installation and Setup](#installation-and-setup) section, and you are currently in the NeMo Agent toolkit virtual environment.

Set your NVIDIA API Key in the `NVIDIA_API_KEY` environment variable.

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY="your_nvidia_api_key"
```

From the git repository root, run the following command to build NeMo Agent toolkit and the simple agent into a Docker image.

```bash
docker build --build-arg NAT_VERSION=$(python -m setuptools_scm) -f examples/getting_started/simple_web_query/Dockerfile -t simple-web-query-agent .
```

Then, run the following command to run the simple agent.

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 -e NVIDIA_API_KEY simple-web-query-agent
```

After the container starts, you can access the agent at http://localhost:8000.

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/generate' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"input_message": "What is LangSmith?"}'
```
