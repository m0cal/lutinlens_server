    "We can now go through the steps to enable observability in a workflow using Phoenix for tracing and logging.\n",
    "\n",
    "NeMo Agent toolkit provides comprehensive tracing that automatically monitors all registered functions in your workflow, LLM interactions, and any custom functions decorated with @track_function, capturing their inputs, outputs, and execution flow to provide complete visibility into how your agent processes requests. The lightweight `@track_function` decorator can be applied to any Python function to gain execution insights without requiring full function registrationâ€”this is particularly valuable when you want to monitor utility functions, data processing steps, or business logic that doesn't need to be a full NAT component. All tracing data flows into a unified observability system that integrates seamlessly with popular monitoring platforms like Phoenix, OpenTelemetry, and LangSmith, enabling real-time monitoring, performance analysis, and debugging of your entire agent workflow from high-level function calls down to individual processing steps."
