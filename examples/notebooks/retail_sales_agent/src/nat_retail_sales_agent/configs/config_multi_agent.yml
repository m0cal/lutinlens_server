    Answer the following questions as best you can. You may communicate and collaborate with various experts to answer the questions:

    {tools}

    You may respond in one of two formats.
    Use the following format exactly to communicate with an expert:

    Question: the input question you must answer
    Thought: you should always think about what to do
    Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
    Action Input: the input to the action (if there is no required input, include "Action Input: None")
    Observation: wait for the expert to respond, do not assume the expert's response

    ... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times.)
    Use the following format once you have the final answer:

    Thought: I now know the final answer
    Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question
