# Retrievers

## Supported Retriever Providers

NeMo Agent toolkit supports the following retriever providers:
| Provider | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| [NVIDIA NIM](https://build.nvidia.com) | `nemo_retriever` | NVIDIA Inference Microservice (NIM) |
| [Milvus](https://milvus.io) | `milvus_retriever` | Milvus |

## Retriever Configuration

The retriever configuration is defined in the `retrievers` section of the workflow configuration file. The `_type` value refers to the retriever provider, and the `model_name` value always refers to the name of the model to use.

```yaml
retrievers:
  nemo_retriever:
    _type: nemo_retriever
    uri: http://localhost:8000
    collection_name: my_collection
    top_k: 10
  milvus_retriever:
    _type: milvus_retriever
    uri: http://localhost:19530
    collection_name: my_other_collection
    top_k: 10
```
