# Observing a Workflow with Phoenix

This guide provides a step-by-step process to enable observability in a NeMo Agent toolkit workflow using Phoenix for tracing and logging. By the end of this guide, you will have:
- Configured telemetry in your workflow.
- Started the Phoenix server locally.
- Ability to view traces in the Phoenix UI.

### Step 1: Install the Phoenix Subpackage

Install the phoenix dependencies to enable tracing capabilities:

```bash
uv pip install -e '.[phoenix]'
```

### Step 2: Start the Phoenix Server

Run the following command to start Phoenix server locally:
```bash
phoenix serve
```
Phoenix should now be accessible at `http://0.0.0.0:6006`.

### Step 3: Modify Workflow Configuration

Update your workflow configuration file to include the telemetry settings.

Example configuration:
```yaml
general:
  telemetry:
    tracing:
      phoenix:
        _type: phoenix
        endpoint: http://localhost:6006/v1/traces
        project: simple_calculator
```
This setup enables tracing through Phoenix at `http://localhost:6006/v1/traces`, with traces grouped into the `simple_calculator` project.

### Step 4: Run Your Workflow

From the root directory of the NeMo Agent toolkit library, install dependencies and run the pre-configured `simple_calculator_observability` example.

**Example:**
```bash
# Install the workflow and plugins
uv pip install -e examples/observability/simple_calculator_observability/

# Run the workflow with Phoenix telemetry settings
nat run --config_file examples/observability/simple_calculator_observability/configs/config-phoenix.yml --input "What is 1*2?"
```
As the workflow runs, telemetry data will start showing up in Phoenix.

### Step 5: View Traces Data in Phoenix

- Open your browser and navigate to `http://0.0.0.0:6006`.
- Locate your workflow traces under your project name in projects.
- Inspect function execution details, latency, total tokens, request timelines and other info under Info and Attributes tab of an individual trace.

### Debugging

If you encounter issues while downloading the Phoenix package, try uninstalling and installing:
```bash
uv pip uninstall arize-phoenix

uv pip install arize-phoenix
```

After reinstalling, restart the Phoenix server:
```bash
phoenix serve
```
