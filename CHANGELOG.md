## [1.2.0] - 2025-08-20
### ðŸ“¦ Overview
The NeMo Agent toolkit, formerly known as Agent Intelligence (AIQ) toolkit, has been renamed to align with the NVIDIA NeMo family of products. This release brings significant new capabilities and improvements across authentication, resource management, observability, and developer experience. The toolkit continues to offer backwards compatibility, making the transition seamless for existing users.

While NeMo Agent Toolkit is designed to be compatible with the previous version, users are encouraged to update their code to follow the latest conventions and best practices. Migration instructions are provided in the [migration guide](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit/blob/release/1.2/docs/source/resources/migration-guide.md).
